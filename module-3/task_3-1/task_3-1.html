      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p> If wake-up time is not 7, then it will return false, then no value will return. If wake-up time is exactly 7, then it will return true, and the code block will execute and say "I can catch the bus to school"</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p> If wake-up time is not 7, then it will go to if else statement and return "car to school". If wake-up time is exactly 7, then if will go to if statement and return "bus to school".
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p> If wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8, nothing happens because the values have not been included to the code.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p> If the number is exactly 0, then its neither positive or negative, but prints out "zero"."</p>
